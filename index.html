		<h2>ðŸŽ® A brief history of games ðŸŽ®</h2>
		<p>The first video game (which is not pong) to be made was by a physicist named William Higimbotham in 1958. Higimbotham created a game called "Tennis for Two". This game had two people on diffrent controllers and there was a moving ball on the screen. Each player has a line that bounces the ball over which looks like a tennis court net. The ball would fly over and each player had the chance to hit it. You can learn more about it and the creator here.</p>
