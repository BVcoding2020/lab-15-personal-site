		<p>	The first video game (which is not pong) to be made was by a physicist named William Higimbotham in 1958. Higimbotham created a game called "Tennis for Two". This game had two people on diffrent controllers and there was a moving ball on the screen. Each player has a line that bounces the ball over which looks like a tennis court net. The ball would fly over and each player had the chance to hit it. You can learn more about it and the creator here.</p>

		<p>	Pacman is the little yellow ball that chomps on yellow pellets and fruit and avoids all of the ghosts until he gets a Super pellet.

It came out on May 21, 1980. Other games were also released because of Pacman as arcade games. Pacman could be played from an authetic arcade machine or just from a keyboard. </p>
