	<h2>About me!</h2>
	<p>My name is Brielle and the goals I want to achieve are graduating college with a degree. This is one of my goals because i will feel as i have gotten through this challenging part of my life that has taken so long to get through. Another goal is to be able to find a career choice that will fit into what my intrests are. My interests are working with any technology such as computers, inovative tech, and any other type that i may have not discovered yet. I hope that i will be able to pass all of my classes in these next few semesters and get through all of my work. I also hope that i will be able to experience more than what i ahve in the first semester. It felt very short and not as much time that i would have wanted to have. But, hopefully i'll be able to move on in my life and work hard.</p>
